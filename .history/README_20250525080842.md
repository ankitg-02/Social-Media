Social Media Satisfaction Prediction
Project Description
This project aims to predict user satisfaction scores based on social media usage patterns, demographics, and content consumption habits. Using machine learning techniques, the model estimates how satisfied a user is likely to be with their social media experience by analyzing key factors such as age, gender, profession, location, preferred social media platform, video watching habits, and video categories.

Features Included
User Demographics: Age, Gender, Profession, and Demographic location (Urban/Rural/Suburban).

Social Media Usage: Preferred platform (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, etc.).

Video Consumption: Time spent watching videos daily and the primary category of videos watched (Entertainment, Education, News, Gaming, Lifestyle, Other).

Prediction Output: A satisfaction score indicating the predicted user satisfaction level.

Project Workflow
Data Collection & Processing
The dataset is sourced from social media usage surveys containing multiple user features and satisfaction scores. Data cleaning and preprocessing are performed, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numeric features.

Model Training
A Random Forest regression model is trained on the processed dataset to learn the relationships between user features and satisfaction scores.

Model Serialization
The trained model and the scaler (StandardScaler) are serialized and saved as pickle files (random_forest.pkl and standard_scaler.pkl) for later inference.

Streamlit Applications

Dashboard (app.py): Provides analytics and visual insights on social media data.

Prediction App (pred_app.py): Allows users to input their profile and social media usage details to predict satisfaction scores.
